    Enter Robin and Adam melodramatically.  They are greatly altered
    in appearance, Robin wearing the haggard aspect of a guilty
    roue; Adam, that of the wicked steward to such a man.

			    My face is the index to my mind,<br>
                All venom and spleen and gall—ha! ha!<br>

                It soon will be reeking,<br>
                With venom and spleen and gall—ha! ha!<br>

			    My name from Adam Goodheart you'll find<br>
                I've changed to Gideon Crawle—ha! ha!<br>
                For bad Bart's steward<br>
                Whose heart is much too hard<br>

		        How dreadful when an innocent heart<br>
                Becomes, perforce, a bad young Bart.,<br>

		      This is a painful state of things, old Adam!

		        Painful, indeed!  Ah, my poor master, when I swore that, come what would, I would serve you in all things for ever,
                I little thought to what a pass it would bring me!  The confidential adviser to the greatest villain unhung!  Now, sir,
                to business.  What crime do you propose to commit to-day?
			</p>

    <h4 class = "name rob">ROB.</h4><p class="speech">
		        How should I know?  As my confidential adviser, it's your duty to suggest something.

    <h4 class = "name adam">ADAM.</h4><p class="speech">
		        Sir, I loathe the life you are leading, but a good old man's oath is paramount, and I obey.  Richard Dauntless is
                here with pretty Rose Maybud, to ask your consent to their marriage.  Poison their beer.
