        <h3>ACT II <br> Scene - The Picture Gallery in Ruddigore Castle</h3>
        
	<p>
    Enter Robin and Adam melodramatically.  They are greatly altered
    in appearance, Robin wearing the haggard aspect of a guilty
    roue; Adam, that of the wicked steward to such a man.
	</p>
                    <h3>DUET—ROBIN and ADAM.</h3>

    <h4>ROB.</h4><p> 
				I once was as meek as a new-born lamb,
				I'm now Sir Murgatroyd—ha! ha!
						With greater precision
						(Without the elision),
				Sir Ruthven Murgatroyd—ha! ha!
			</p>

    <h4>ADAM.</h4><p>
				And I, who was once his valley-de-sham,
				As steward I'm now employed—ha! ha!
						The dickens may take him—
						I'll never forsake him!
				As steward I'm now employed—ha! ha!

			<p>		ADDITIONAL SONG
				(Omitted after opening night.)
			</p>
			</p>

    <h4>ROB.</h4><p>
			    My face is the index to my mind,
                All venom and spleen and gall—ha! ha!
                Or, properly speaking,
                It soon will be reeking,
                With venom and spleen and gall—ha! ha!
			</p>

    <h4>ADAM.</h4><p>
			    My name from Adam Goodheart you'll find
                I've changed to Gideon Crawle—ha! ha!
                For bad Bart's steward
                Whose heart is much too hard
                Is always Gideon Crawle—ha! ha!
			</p>

    <h4>BOTH.</h4><p>
		        How dreadful when an innocent heart
                Becomes, perforce, a bad young Bart.,
                And still more hard on old Adam,
                His former faithful valley-de-sham!
			</p>

    <h4>ROB.</h4><p>
		      This is a painful state of things, old Adam!
			</p>

    <h4>ADAM.</h4><p>
		        Painful, indeed!  Ah, my poor master, when I swore
                that, come what would, I would serve you in all things for ever,
                I little thought to what a pass it would bring me!  The
                confidential adviser to the greatest villain unhung!  Now, sir,
                to business.  What crime do you propose to commit to-day?
			</p>

    <h4>ROB.</h4><p>
		        How should I know?  As my confidential adviser, it's
                your duty to suggest something.
				</p>

    <h4>ADAM.</h4><p>
		        Sir, I loathe the life you are leading, but a good
                old man's oath is paramount, and I obey.  Richard Dauntless is
                here with pretty Rose Maybud, to ask your consent to their
                marriage.  Poison their beer.
