        <h3>ACT II <br> Scene - The Picture Gallery in Ruddigore Castle</h3>
        <pre>
    Enter Robin and Adam melodramatically.  They are greatly altered
    in appearance, Robin wearing the haggard aspect of a guilty
    roue; Adam, that of the wicked steward to such a man.

                    DUET—ROBIN and ADAM.

    ROB.           I once was as meek as a new-born lamb,
                        I'm now Sir Murgatroyd—ha! ha!
                                With greater precision
                                (Without the elision),
                        Sir Ruthven Murgatroyd—ha! ha!

    ADAM.          And I, who was once his valley-de-sham,
                        As steward I'm now employed—ha! ha!
                                The dickens may take him—
                                I'll never forsake him!
                        As steward I'm now employed—ha! ha!

                                ADDITIONAL SONG
                        (Omitted after opening night.)

    ROB.        My face is the index to my mind,
                All venom and spleen and gall—ha! ha!
                Or, properly speaking,
                It soon will be reeking,
                With venom and spleen and gall—ha! ha!

    ADAM.       My name from Adam Goodheart you'll find
                I've changed to Gideon Crawle—ha! ha!
                For bad Bart's steward
                Whose heart is much too hard
                Is always Gideon Crawle—ha! ha!

    BOTH.        How dreadful when an innocent heart
                Becomes, perforce, a bad young Bart.,
                And still more hard on old Adam,
                His former faithful valley-de-sham!

    ROB.        This is a painful state of things, old Adam!

    ADAM.       Painful, indeed!  Ah, my poor master, when I swore
                that, come what would, I would serve you in all things for ever,
                I little thought to what a pass it would bring me!  The
                confidential adviser to the greatest villain unhung!  Now, sir,
                to business.  What crime do you propose to commit to-day?
    ROB.        How should I know?  As my confidential adviser, it's
                your duty to suggest something.
    ADAM.       Sir, I loathe the life you are leading, but a good
                old man's oath is paramount, and I obey.  Richard Dauntless is
                here with pretty Rose Maybud, to ask your consent to their
                marriage.  Poison their beer.
